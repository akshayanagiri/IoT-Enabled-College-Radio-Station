#IoT-Enabled-College-Radio-Station

<mark>Project Overview</mark>

This project is an IoT-enabled college radio station designed to automate and streamline broadcasting tasks. The system allows remote control and management of the radio station using IoT devices, enhancing the traditional radio experience with modern technology. It is developed using ESP32, audio modules, and integrated IoT components for seamless communication and management.

<mark>Features</mark>

The IoT-enabled college radio station project features automated broadcasting, enabling the playback of pre-recorded or live audio streams through IoT devices. It allows for remote control and management of the station via an intuitive interface, providing seamless operation from any location. The system offers real-time monitoring, ensuring the station's status, including volume levels and audio quality, is always under supervision. Additionally, it supports automated scheduling of programs and events, ensuring broadcasts occur at designated times. With ESP32 providing internet connectivity, the radio station can be remotely accessed and managed efficiently.
